# Chess Bot
This is my submission to the Chess Bot challenge run by [Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/@SebastianLague). 

The framework used is [here](https://github.com/SebLague/Chess-Challenge)

This was just a short afternoon project so the bot isn't very good, stemming both from the short time I spent on it and from my lack of chess knowledge.
